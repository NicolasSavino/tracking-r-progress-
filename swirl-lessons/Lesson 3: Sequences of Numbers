## âœ… Key Commands Learned

```r
# Sequence using colon operator
1:20
pi:10
15:1

# Help for operators
?`:`

# Create sequences with more control
seq(1, 20)
seq(0, 10, by = 0.5)
my_seq <- seq(5, 10, length = 30)
length(my_seq)

# Sequence based on another vector
1:length(my_seq)
seq(along.with = my_seq)
seq_along(my_seq)

# Replicate elements
rep(0, times = 40)
rep(c(0, 1, 2), times = 10)
rep(c(0, 1, 2), each = 10)

# Simple sequence from 1 to 20
1:20

# Real number sequence starting from pi
pi:10

# Backwards sequence
15:1

# Custom increments
seq(0, 10, by = 0.5)

# Sequence with specific length
my_seq <- seq(5, 10, length = 30)

# Index sequence matching vector length
seq_along(my_seq)

# Repetition
rep(0, times = 40)
rep(c(0, 1, 2), times = 10)
rep(c(0, 1, 2), each = 10)
