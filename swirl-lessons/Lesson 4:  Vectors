# Basic R Practice: Vectors and Output

This script demonstrates how to create numeric and character vectors in R, useful for anyone just getting started with the language.

## ðŸ“Œ Concepts Practiced

- Using `c()` to create vectors
- Storing numeric and character data
- Using `paste()` to concatenate character strings
- Printing output in the R console
- Handling potential sink() errors

Code Breakdown

```r
# Create a numeric vector
num_vect <- c(0.5, 55, -10, 6)

# Create a character vector
my_char <- c("My", "name", "is")

# Combine character vector into a single string
full_sentence <- paste(my_char, collapse = " ")

# Output everything to console
print(num_vect)
print(my_char)
print(full_sentence)

# Numeric vector containing 0.5, 55, -10, and 6
num_vect <- c(0.5, 55, -10, 6)

# Character vector containing the words "My", "name", "is"
my_char <- c("My", "name", "is")

# Optional: Combine into a sentence
full_sentence <- paste(my_char, collapse = " ")

# Print everything
print(num_vect)
print(my_char)
print(full_sentence)

# Just in case you were getting file errors, close any sink() connections
sink()
